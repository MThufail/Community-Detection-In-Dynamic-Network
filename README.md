# Community-Detection-In-Dynamic-Network

The main goal of this research is to identify a method for eliciting information about terrorist attack suspects by examining terror attacks over time. The aim is to create a sociogram, or a network of criminals, in which the nodes represent terrorist groups and the edges represent generic interactions between two groups. We used a method that allows us to detect clusters of terror groups that are similar in terms of organizational characteristics. Specifically, we built a network of terrorist groups and related information on tactics, weapons, targets and active regions using open access data from terrorist attacks that occurred worldwide since 1970, from START organization.
